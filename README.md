# Data Science Explained :bar_chart: :test_tube:

Welcome to this repo, a hotchpoch of data science! Here you will find:
* Common algorithms coded from scratch
* Tutorials and theory to understand DS concepts
* Useful tools
* Anything that comes to my mind related to DS

The idea is to keep together some of the important gadgets that I've used along my bachelor, master and daily life as a data scientist. Feel free to contribute and share you feedback!
